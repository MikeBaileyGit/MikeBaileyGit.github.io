## Cloud Computing


#### Achievements
Georgetown scholars have used [cloud computing](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mdi_computing_resources-1.pdf) to connect new forms of large-scale data to societal scale issues ranging from corruption in public-private partnerships to climate change to understanding civil service to global biodiversity. Some projects have created databases that will become shared repositories for researchers  while others involve large-scale simulations.

#### Services
We provide access to cloud computing for faculty who need large-scale and fast computing resources.  Our services include compute clusters, large-scale databases including Postgres and BigQuery and access to statistical packages for large-scale data and private cloud-based storage. 

We will be increasing our services next year to include creation of data portals and data labeling services using Mechanical Turk.

]

.pull-right[
The National Fisheries Institute represents seafood importers.  They were interested in understanding the effects of a regulatory change on imports and refusals.  Working with students trained in data-science, MDI produced a report showing that the shift in regulatory authority led to more refusals at the border overall, but fewer safety-based refusals.

This project is part of a broader MDI effort to connect students to policymakers.
