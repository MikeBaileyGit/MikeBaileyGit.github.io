## Computing Resources


#### Achievements
Georgetown scholars have used [cloud computing](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mdi_computing_resources-1.pdf) to connect new forms of large-scale data to societal scale issues ranging from corruption in public-private partnerships to climate change to understanding civil service to global biodiversity. Some projects have created databases that will become shared repositories for researchers  while others involve large-scale simulations.

#### Services
We provide access to cloud computing for faculty who need large-scale and fast computing resources.  Our services include compute clusters, large-scale databases including Postgres and BigQuery and access to statistical packages for large-scale data and private cloud-based storage. 

We will be increasing our services next year to include creation of data portals and data labeling services using Mechanical Turk.

## Federal Statistical Research Data Center 

#### Achievements
The [Federal Statistical Research Data Center](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/research-data-center/) is a joint project by the Census Bureau and the Massive Data Institute that provides a secure data lab to enable research on restricted data sets.  The FSRDC has generated interest across area non-profits and institutions.  Scholars using our U.S. Census Bureau Research Data Center have produced multiple [working](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cen/wpaper/18-48.html) [papers](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/skilled-tradable-services-the-transformation-of-us-high-skill-labor-markets) and [journal articles](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190029&amp;&amp;from=f).

#### Services
MDI provides access to non-public U.S. Census data at our secure on-sight U.S. Census Research Data Center.  We support researchers by helping them learn about what data is available, apply for access and, if approved, to access the data.  Executive Director Amy O'Hara serves on the FSRDC Technical Committee and on the FSRDC Budget Committee.  She also works with the Census Bureau to streamline data request processes and improve linkage methods.

## Data curation

#### Achievements
We have developed efficient approaches for storing and processing large-scale data sets. Currently, we have eight projects that are curating different social media and newspaper data sets.

#### Services
MDI can provide scholars with access to certain specific data sets.  One is a large scale database of more than 700 million publicly available, open-source media articles and blog posts actively compiled since 2006 from a wide range of non-English sources.  Another is a very large data set of anonymized credit information.

MDI also makes available [administrative data metadata](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/research-data-center/administrative-data-metadata/) obtained through data use agreements with federal and state agencies which show the specific data elements shared with the census in order to improve research designs and increase the specificity of proposals.

#### Case study
## Student-led projects

#### MDI Partners with National Fisheries Institute to analyze regulatory change

.pull-left[
.center[&lt;img src="Figures/request_monthlyImportRefusalByCountryBar.png"; style="max-width:520px;float:center;"&gt;]

]

.pull-right[
The National Fisheries Institute represents seafood importers.  They were interested in understanding the effects of a regulatory change on imports and refusals.  Working with students trained in data-science, MDI produced a report showing that the shift in regulatory authority led to more refusals at the border overall, but fewer safety-based refusals.

This project is part of a broader MDI effort to connect students to policymakers.
